  Abstract                 = {The Papers in this volume analyze and evaluate the problems and challenges that confront Pakistan as a dynamic, diverse and complex society undergoing modernization and change. The central argument of this book is that the contexts and contours of Pakistan are undergoing radical transformations; as the military realigns itself in the global arena; as Islamic forces re-evaluate and redesign their strategies in society; and as new dynamics with United States, China, Russia, India and Central Asian states are being forged. The papers in this volume, on the one hand, provide diverging and competing visions of Pakistan and on the other, reveal how traditional social order and culture are adapting to forces of modernization and globalization. It analyzes the issues of national identity and state formation, Islamization, rise of Jihadi groups and their relationship with the military; de-institutionalization of political parties; erosion of liberal values and challenges of constructing democracy, imperatives of state security and globalization.The book ventures to explain the disabilities, constraints, and missed opportunities and provides a new framework of dialogue and debate on the study of Pakistan. How Pakistan is responding to these domestic and global challenges need to be evaluated by focusing on the capacity and performance of the state and society.},

This is the first reference book to bring together detailed discussions of the historical development and specialized linguistic structures and features of this vast language family.

	abstract = {We introduce an experimental paradigm for studying the cumulative cultural evolution of language. In doing so we provide the first experimental validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations, without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners. Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

  Abstract                 = {Data from four little-studied varieties of Indo-Aryan (Southern Palula, Northern Palula, Sawi and Kalkoti) spoken in the Hindu Kush is analyzed and discussed from a historical-comparative perspective. Evidence is presented showing that Kalkoti, until recently only tentatively classified, is part of this particular cluster of closely-related Shina varieties. An attempt is made at reconstructing some phonological and grammatical features of a common source speech, here named Proto-Dangari, and the order in which the present-day varieties may have split off. An important conclusion drawn is that Southern and Northern Palula probably are more distantly related than present-day similarities seem to indicate, the high degree of synchronic similarity instead being due to relatively recent convergence taking place in southern Chitral. It is hypothesized that the present speech communities are the result of two different westward routes of migration, one geographically linking Southern Palula (Ashreti) and Sawi with Chilas, the other linking Northern Palula (Biori) and Kalkoti with Tangir, both located in the same general area of the main Indus Valley.},

  Abstract                 = {The book provides an overview of the alignment patterns found in modern Indo-Aryan languages. The analysis of the patterns of case marking and agreement leads to a balanced view on the concept of ergativity and evaluates its value for typological linguistics. The book offers an extensive discussion of previous approaches to ergativity. It analyzes four Indo-Aryan languages Asamiya, Nepali, Rajasthani and Kashmiri on the basis of text corpora. Examples from other Indo-Aryan languages are also adduced. The book is a thorough synchronic study of alignment patterns in Indo-Aryan languages."},
